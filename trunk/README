A podcast downloader in Perl

Brad Peters <brad@fubarpa.com>

-----------------------------------
CastGrab is a script which will parse your subscription list
and download any new podcasts into the directory specified in
the script itself.  CastGrab keeps a historical file to track
which podcasts have been downloaded.

------------------------------------
This script is free software; you can redistribute it and/or 
modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.
------------------------------------

If this script eats your partition for breakfast, it's not my 
fault.  RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I've tested this on my machine, 
it is still functioning.
-----------------------------------

Requirements:

Perl 5.8.4

Perl modules:
XML::DOM 
LWP::UserAgent


Installation
---------------------------------------
1  Copy castgrab.pl to any directory you choose and make it
   executeable (chmod +x castgrab.pl).

2  Run the setup-castgrab.sh script to create the .castgrab
   directory and set up the initial subscriptions and history
   file

3  Edit the subscriptions file to add your favorite podcast
   feeds. The filename is ~/.castgrab/subscriptions.  The 
   format for an entry is:

   Description::URL

   I've included one sample feed for the Dawn and Drew Show
   as an example.

4  Edit castgrab.pl and change the variables as noted in the
   comments


Running CastGrab
----------------------------------------
Castgrab can be run manually or from cron.  If you run it from
cron, I recommend setting it to check your feeds once per day.

Castgrab generates a logfile (~/.castgrab/castgrab.log) to let 
you know what's going on.
